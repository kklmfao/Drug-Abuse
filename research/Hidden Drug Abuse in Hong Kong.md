# **Hidden Drug Abuse in Hong Kong**

While official statistics suggest a decline in drug abuse cases in Hong Kong, a growing body of research reveals a concerning trend of hidden drug abuse. This phenomenon, characterized by individuals concealing their drug use, poses significant challenges to detection, intervention, and understanding the true scope of the problem. This report delves into the factors contributing to hidden drug abuse in Hong Kong, drawing upon recent academic studies to shed light on this complex issue.

## **Shifting Patterns of Drug Abuse**

Although reported drug abuse cases have decreased in recent years, this decline may not accurately reflect the reality of the situation. Drug abusers are increasingly concealing their drug use, making it more difficult for authorities and social service agencies to identify them (Tam et al., 2018). This shift towards hidden drug abuse is attributed to several factors:

* **Changes in drug preferences:** The rise in popularity of psychotropic substances, such as methamphetamine and cocaine, has contributed to the hidden drug abuse trend (Chan et al., 2020). These drugs often have less apparent dependence symptoms and physical signs compared to heroin, leading to delayed help-seeking behavior (Tam et al., 2023). Users may not recognize the severity of their addiction until prolonged use has resulted in significant health or social consequences.  
* **Stringent legal approaches:** Fear of legal repercussions associated with drug use can deter individuals from seeking help or disclosing their addiction (Tam et al., 2023). This fear of self-disclosure further drives drug use underground, making it harder to identify and support those who need help.  
* **Displacement effects:** Increased law enforcement efforts targeting drug activities in public spaces, such as nightclubs and rave parties, may have inadvertently pushed drug use into private settings, like homes and small gatherings (Tam et al., 2018). This displacement effect makes it more challenging to detect and monitor drug abuse.

This shift is evident in the decline of public, large-scale discos and the rise of an "underground rave culture"â€“smaller, less structured gatherings in private residences, resort houses, or industrial units (Chan et al., 2020). These clandestine settings provide a haven for drug use, further concealing it from the authorities and contributing to the hidden drug abuse problem.

## **The Role of Social Networks**

Social networks play a crucial role in facilitating hidden drug abuse. Drug users often rely on close-knit social circles to obtain drugs, share information, and provide support, creating a hidden network that enables continued drug use (Chan et al., 2020). This network operates with high levels of secrecy and trust, making it difficult for outsiders to penetrate and identify those involved in drug abuse.

Bonding, bridging, and linking social capital: These forms of social capital contribute to the strength and resilience of hidden drug networks (Chan et al., 2020). Bonding social capital refers to the strong ties and shared values within a group of drug users, fostering trust and mutual support. Bridging social capital connects different groups of drug users, expanding their network and access to drugs. Linking social capital connects individuals to those in positions of power, potentially providing protection or access to resources. These connections provide drug users with access to resources, support, and protection, further enabling hidden drug abuse.

* **Convenient supply modes:** Hidden drug networks offer convenient and discreet ways to obtain drugs, often through trusted friends or acquaintances (Chan et al., 2020). This ease of access contributes to the persistence of drug use and makes it harder for authorities to disrupt supply chains.  
* **Psychological comfort and safety:** Drug users often find psychological comfort and a sense of belonging within their hidden networks (Chan et al., 2020). These networks provide a safe space where they can use drugs without fear of judgment or legal consequences, further reinforcing their drug use patterns.

## **Drug Abuse Cases in Hong Kong**

Examining specific drug abuse cases in Hong Kong provides further context for understanding the hidden drug abuse problem. In 2023, there was a 3% increase in the total number of reported drug abusers compared to the previous year, with heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine being the most common drugs abused (Drug abuse and drug situation in Hong Kong in 2023, 2024). Among young drug abusers under 21, cocaine, cannabis, and ketamine were the most prevalent (Drug abuse and drug situation in Hong Kong in 2023, 2024). These figures, however, likely underestimate the true extent of drug abuse due to the hidden nature of the problem.

Data from the first half of 2024 showed a decrease in the overall number of reported drug abusers, but an increase in young drug abusers under 21, with a significant number abusing "space oil" (Drug abuse and drug situation in Hong Kong in the first half of 2024, 2024). This highlights the dynamic nature of the drug abuse problem and the emergence of new trends. It is important to note that these statistics may be influenced by various factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic and related measures, as well as changes in law enforcement strategies and reporting practices (Youth Drug Abuse: Serious Drug Offences in Hong Kong, 2025).

## **Consequences of Hidden Drug Abuse**

The hidden nature of drug abuse presents several challenges:

* **Delayed intervention:** As drug users conceal their addiction, they are less likely to receive timely interventions and support. This delay can lead to more severe health consequences, social problems, and difficulties in recovery. The problem of hidden drug abuse is further compounded by the tendency for prolonged drug use, as individuals may continue their substance abuse for extended periods before seeking help (Experience of Drug Abusers Participating in Community-Based Drug, 2025).  
* **Underestimation of the problem:** Hidden drug abuse makes it difficult to accurately assess the true extent of drug use in the community. This underestimation can hinder the development of effective prevention and treatment programs.  
* **Increased risk of harm:** Individuals engaging in hidden drug use may be at higher risk of overdose, adverse health effects, and social isolation. The lack of oversight and support within hidden networks can exacerbate these risks. Hidden drug abuse can also lead to social isolation as individuals experience increased anxiety, suspicion, and a decline in trust among their peers (Tam et al., 2018). This withdrawal from social connections can further exacerbate the negative consequences of drug abuse and hinder recovery.  
* **Challenges in identification:** Identifying hidden drug abusers is a significant challenge. However, the "Ask, Warn, Advise, Refer and Do-it-again" (AWARD) model, commonly used for smoking cessation, has shown promise in enhancing people's confidence in making referrals to anti-drug services (Tam et al., 2023). This model could be further explored as a potential tool for identifying and supporting hidden drug abusers.

## **Conclusion**

Hidden drug abuse is a growing concern in Hong Kong, driven by a complex interplay of factors, including changing drug preferences, stringent legal approaches, and the dynamics of social networks. This phenomenon poses significant challenges to identifying and supporting individuals struggling with addiction, and it underscores the need for innovative strategies to address this hidden epidemic. The consequences of hidden drug abuse are far-reaching, including delayed intervention, underestimation of the problem, increased risk of harm, and social isolation. Further research is crucial to gain a deeper understanding of the scope and impact of hidden drug abuse in Hong Kong. Future studies could focus on:

* Exploring the specific characteristics and needs of hidden drug abusers.  
* Investigating the role of online platforms and social media in facilitating hidden drug use.  
* Evaluating the effectiveness of different intervention strategies for hidden drug abuse.  
* Examining the long-term consequences of hidden drug abuse on individuals and communities.

By addressing these research gaps, we can develop more effective strategies to prevent and address this hidden public health issue.

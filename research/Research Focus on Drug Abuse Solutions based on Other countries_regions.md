## **Introduction**

Drug abuse, a complex societal issue with far-reaching consequences, often remains hidden due to various factors, including stigma, fear of legal repercussions, and lack of awareness. This necessitates a proactive approach to identify and address the problem effectively. While many countries grapple with high drug abuse prevalence, some have successfully implemented strategies to mitigate this issue. This research focuses on countries with reportedly low drug abuse rates, aiming to understand their unique approaches and the impact of their solutions.

The research examines five countries: Norway, New Zealand, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and Australia. These countries have been selected based on reports and indices suggesting lower drug abuse prevalence compared to global averages. For instance, the Global Drug Policy Index ranks Norway, New Zealand, and Portugal among the top three countries with the most favorable drug policies1. Furthermore, data on the prevalence of opiates use indicates that Norway has a relatively low rate compared to other European countries2. The study delves into their specific solutions, including drug treatment courts, harm reduction programs, decriminalization policies, and comprehensive treatment and rehabilitation initiatives. By analyzing these countries' successes, challenges, and the factors contributing to their positive outcomes, this research aims to provide valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders worldwide.

## **Methodology**

This research employed a comprehensive literature review methodology, primarily utilizing Google Scholar to identify relevant academic journals and reports. The search focused on countries with low drug abuse prevalence, as indicated by reports like the Global Drug Policy Index and studies on opiate use prevalence1. Subsequently, the research explored the specific solutions implemented in these countries, prioritizing academic journals with "doi" to ensure credibility and accuracy.

The research process involved the following steps:

1. **Identifying Countries with Low Drug Abuse Prevalence:** Google Scholar was used to search for reports, indices, and studies indicating countries with low drug abuse rates. The search employed keywords such as "low drug abuse prevalence," "countries with low drug use," and "drug policy index." Reports such as the Global Drug Policy Index and studies on opiate use prevalence were analyzed to identify countries with favorable drug policies and low drug use rates1.  
2. **Exploring Solutions Implemented:** Further searches on Google Scholar focused on the specific solutions employed by the identified countries to address drug abuse. Keywords used in this step included "drug treatment courts," "harm reduction programs," "drug decriminalization," and "drug rehabilitation." The search was refined to include country-specific terms, such as "drug policy in Norway" or "drug treatment in Australia."  
3. **Analyzing Academic Journals:** The research prioritized academic journals with "doi" that discussed the solutions and their impact in detail. This ensured that the information gathered was credible and based on rigorous research. Preference was given to articles published in reputable journals with a focus on drug policy, public health, and criminal justice.  
4. **Synthesizing Findings:** The findings from various sources were synthesized to provide a comprehensive overview of each country's approach and its effectiveness. This involved comparing and contrasting different solutions, analyzing their impact on drug-related indicators, and identifying key factors contributing to their success.

## **Harm Reduction Strategies**

Harm reduction is a public health approach that aims to minimize the negative health, social, and economic consequences associated with drug use. It acknowledges that drug use is a reality and focuses on reducing the harms associated with it, rather than solely aiming for abstinence. Harm reduction strategies are implemented in various countries, including those examined in this research, and encompass a range of interventions, such as:

* **Needle and Syringe Programs (NSPs):** Provide clean needles and syringes to people who inject drugs to prevent the spread of blood-borne viruses like HIV and Hepatitis C.  
* **Opioid Agonist Therapy (OAT):** Involves the use of medications like methadone and buprenorphine to treat opioid dependence, reduce cravings, and prevent withdrawal symptoms.  
* **Naloxone Distribution:** Makes naloxone, an overdose reversal medication, readily available to people who use opioids and their families to prevent overdose deaths.  
* **Drug Consumption Rooms (DCRs):** Provide a safe and supervised environment for people to use drugs, reducing the risk of overdose and other harms associated with public drug use.  
* **Drug Checking Services:** Allow people to test their drugs for purity and composition, providing them with information to make informed decisions about their drug use.

These harm reduction strategies have been shown to be effective in reducing drug-related harms and improving public health outcomes. They are often implemented alongside other interventions, such as treatment and social support services, to provide a comprehensive approach to addressing drug abuse.

## **Norway: Drug Treatment Courts and Harm Reduction**

Norway has adopted a multi-pronged approach to address drug abuse, with drug treatment courts and harm reduction strategies playing a crucial role. Drug treatment courts offer an alternative to imprisonment for offenders with substance use disorders, providing court-supervised treatment and rehabilitation programs3. This approach aims to reduce drug dependence and related criminal activity by providing comprehensive support and monitoring3. The drug treatment court program consists of four phases: the instigation phase, the stabilization phase, the responsibility phase, and the continuation phase. Each phase is designed to meet the individual needs of the offender and includes court-controlled treatment and rehabilitation activities3.

In addition to drug treatment courts, Norway has implemented a National Overdose Prevention Strategy, focusing on low-threshold access to opioid agonist treatment (OAT) and harm reduction services4. This includes providing naloxone, safe drug consumption rooms, and prescription guidelines for opioid treatment of chronic pain4. These measures aim to reduce overdose deaths and promote safer drug use practices. Widespread access to OAT and harm reduction has proven to be cost-effective in reducing the overdose burden4.

Norway's approach also emphasizes social reintegration and support for individuals with substance use disorders5. This includes providing training opportunities, housing, and employment support to address the underlying factors contributing to drug abuse5. Furthermore, Norway is undergoing a drug reform process, aiming to transfer responsibility for responses to drug use from the justice sector to the health sector5. This reflects a shift towards a more health-oriented approach to drug policy.

**Key Features of Norway's Approach:**

* Drug treatment courts as an alternative to imprisonment.  
* National Overdose Prevention Strategy with a focus on OAT and harm reduction.  
* Social reintegration programs to support long-term recovery.  
* Drug reform process transferring responsibility for drug use responses to the health sector.

## **New Zealand: A Health-Based Approach and Harm Reduction**

New Zealand's National Drug Policy guides the country's efforts to prevent and reduce drug-related harm6. The policy emphasizes a health-based approach, recognizing drug use as a health issue rather than solely a criminal justice matter7. This approach promotes harm reduction strategies, aiming to minimize the negative impacts of drug use on individuals and communities6. New Zealand's national drug policy has evolved since its launch in 1998, with a focus on harm minimization and a balance of measures to reduce harm, reduce demand, and control supply8.

New Zealand has implemented various harm reduction initiatives, including needle exchange programs, drug checking services, and overdose prevention sites7. These programs aim to reduce the risks associated with drug use, such as the spread of blood-borne viruses and overdose deaths7.

The country also focuses on community engagement and collaboration, recognizing the importance of involving people who use drugs and their families in developing and implementing solutions9. This participatory approach ensures that policies and programs are tailored to the needs of the community and effectively address the specific challenges they face. Addressing social, cultural, economic, and environmental determinants of health is crucial for achieving health equity and reducing drug harm9.

New Zealand's Alcohol and Other Drug Strategy 2021-2026 further strengthens the country's commitment to a health-based approach10. This strategy focuses on a wellbeing approach, moving from a deficit approach to a focus on enabling oranga, which means wellbeing in the Māori language10. It emphasizes restoring oranga tāngata, delivering equitable health outcomes for Māori, and working in partnership with Māori to design and evaluate intervention and treatment pathways10.

**Key Features of New Zealand's Approach:**

* National Drug Policy with a health-based approach.  
* Harm reduction initiatives to minimize drug-related risks.  
* Community engagement and collaboration in policy development.  
* Alcohol and Other Drug Strategy 2021-2026 with a focus on wellbeing and oranga.

## **Portugal: Decriminalization and a Focus on Treatment**

Portugal gained international recognition for its decriminalization of all drugs in 200111. This policy shifted the focus from criminal punishment to public health, treating drug use as a health issue rather than a crime11. Under this model, individuals found possessing small amounts of drugs are referred to Dissuasion Commissions, composed of health professionals who assess their situation and recommend treatment or other support services11.

Portugal's approach emphasizes voluntary treatment and social reintegration11. Treatment is never mandated, and individuals are encouraged to seek help without fear of legal consequences11. The country also invests in social reintegration programs to support individuals in their recovery and re-entry into society11.

This approach has led to significant improvements in various drug-related indicators, including reduced overdose deaths, HIV infections, and incarceration rates11. Portugal's experience demonstrates that decriminalization, coupled with a strong focus on treatment and harm reduction, can be an effective strategy to address drug abuse. However, it is important to note that decriminalization alone is not sufficient for success; it needs to be combined with a commitment to treatment, harm reduction, and social reintegration11.

A central element of Portugal's decriminalization policy is the system of Commissions for the Dissuasion of Drug Addiction (CTDs)12. These regional panels, composed of social workers, legal advisors, and medical professionals, assess individuals found in possession of drugs and provide targeted responses, including referrals to drug treatment programs if needed12. The CTDs aim to provide a personalized and health-centered approach to addressing drug use.

The impact of Portugal's decriminalization policy has been significant. Drug-related deaths have remained below the EU average since 2001, and the proportion of prisoners sentenced for drug offenses has fallen from 40% to 15%13. Rates of drug use have also remained consistently below the EU average13.

**Key Features of Portugal's Approach:**

* Decriminalization of all drugs for personal use.  
* Dissuasion Commissions to assess and recommend support services.  
* Voluntary treatment and social reintegration programs.  
* Health-centered approach with a focus on individual needs.

## **United Kingdom: Harm Reduction and Treatment Investments**

The United Kingdom has a long history of harm reduction initiatives, with a focus on minimizing the negative health and social impacts of drug use14. The country has implemented various harm reduction programs, including needle and syringe programs, opioid agonist therapy, and naloxone distribution14. These programs aim to reduce the spread of blood-borne viruses, prevent overdose deaths, and support individuals in their recovery. The UK applies harm reduction principles by working with people without judgment, coercion, or discrimination, and by not requiring that people stop using drugs as a precondition of support15.

In recent years, the UK government has increased investments in treatment and recovery services16. The 2021 drug strategy allocated significant funding to enhance treatment capacity, expand access to services, and improve the quality of care16. This includes increasing the number of treatment places, providing support for people experiencing homelessness, and ensuring treatment access for offenders with addiction16.

Despite these efforts, challenges remain in addressing drug-related deaths and preventing drug use among young people16. The UK government acknowledges the need for a more effective drug prevention system and plans to develop new initiatives to tackle prevention in the coming years16. One significant challenge is the declining emphasis on harm reduction and the increasing priority placed on crime reduction and abstinent recovery17. This shift in focus may hinder the effectiveness of harm reduction programs and limit access to support services for people who use drugs.

**Key Features of the United Kingdom's Approach:**

* Long-standing harm reduction programs to minimize drug-related harms.  
* Increased investments in treatment and recovery services.  
* Ongoing efforts to improve drug prevention strategies.  
* A shift in focus from harm reduction to crime reduction and abstinent recovery.

## **Australia: Comprehensive Treatment and Rehabilitation**

Australia has a comprehensive system of drug treatment and rehabilitation programs, offering a range of services to address various needs18. These include residential detoxification, home-based withdrawal services, individual counseling, residential rehabilitation, group therapy, and pharmacotherapy medication18. Treatment options are available in community-based treatment centers and residential rehabilitation services19.

The country also provides support services for families and friends of people who use drugs, recognizing the impact of drug abuse on the wider community18. These services offer support, information, and guidance to help families cope with the challenges of addiction18.

Australia has specialized services for specific populations, including young people, women, and Aboriginal people18. These services are tailored to address the unique needs and challenges faced by these groups, ensuring culturally appropriate and effective care18.

Turning Point is a leading addiction treatment, education, and research center in Australia20. It provides a wide range of clinical care and support for people and families affected by addiction, including those seeking help for the first time20. Turning Point also plays a crucial role in driving change and reducing stigma associated with addiction20.

The Salvation Army also provides a range of drug and alcohol support services across Australia21. These include withdrawal management, residential rehabilitation, non-residential rehabilitation, community programs, and harm reduction services21. The Salvation Army's approach focuses on supporting individuals in their recovery journey and helping them achieve a sense of belonging and purpose in their lives21.

**Key Features of Australia's Approach:**

* Comprehensive drug treatment and rehabilitation programs.  
* Support services for families and friends of people who use drugs.  
* Specialized services for specific populations.  
* Leading addiction treatment centers like Turning Point.  
* Support services provided by organizations like The Salvation Army.

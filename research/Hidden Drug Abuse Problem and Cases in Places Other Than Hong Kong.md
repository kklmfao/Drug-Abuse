# **Hidden Drug Abuse Problem and Cases in Places Other Than Hong Kong**

Drug abuse is a serious public health problem with devastating consequences for individuals, families, and communities. While official statistics may show a decline in reported drug abuse cases, there is growing concern about the hidden nature of this problem. This research focus explores the hidden drug abuse problem and cases in various regions, drawing upon academic journals and research reports, with a particular focus on regions outside of Hong Kong.

## **Drug Production and Trafficking in Asia**

The Asia Pacific region faces significant challenges related to drug production and trafficking. A study published in the journal *Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy* provides an overview of recreational drug use in the region (McKetin et al., 2018). While data gaps exist for some countries, the report highlights the significant role of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) programs in improving data collection networks, particularly in East and Southeast Asia (McKetin et al., 2018). The study emphasizes the need for continued efforts to gather accurate data on drug production and use to effectively address the hidden drug abuse problem.

### **Drug Production in the Asia Pacific Region**

The majority of global illicit opium production occurs in Asia, with Afghanistan and Myanmar being major producers (McKetin et al., 2018). Cannabis production is widespread throughout Asia, with cannabis herb production across all regions and cannabis resin production concentrated in Afghanistan and neighboring Southwest and Central Asian countries (McKetin et al., 2018). Asia also has significant clandestine production of Amphetamine-Type Stimulants (ATS), particularly methamphetamine, mainly concentrated in East and Southeast Asia (McKetin et al., 2018). Ketamine production is also prevalent in Asia, particularly in India and China, with some of it being diverted from pharmaceutical supplies (McKetin et al., 2018). In recent years, there has been increasing production of novel psychoactive substances ('legal highs') in Asia, particularly in China and some other countries in Southeast and South Asia (McKetin et al., 2018).

| Country | Drug Type | Prevalence | Source |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Afghanistan | Opioids | 2.7% of the population aged 15–64 | McKetin et al., 2018 |
| Iran | Opioids | 2.3% of the population aged 15–64 | McKetin et al., 2018 |
| Myanmar | Opium | 1.7% of the population in opium-growing villages | McKetin et al., 2018 |

### **Drug Trafficking Between Myanmar and China**

A research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice examines cross-border drug trafficking between Myanmar and China2. The study reveals that most drug traffickers involved are poorly educated and have limited economic opportunities, often resorting to drug trafficking as a means of survival2. The report highlights the adaptive nature of the drug trafficking business, which constantly evolves in response to law enforcement efforts and market trends. This adaptability contributes to the hidden nature of drug abuse, as traffickers employ sophisticated methods to avoid detection. **For example, traffickers often transport drugs in small quantities, using individuals who know very little about the operation as mules.** 2 **This reliance on vulnerable individuals and decentralized networks makes it more difficult for law enforcement to track and disrupt drug trafficking operations.** 2 **Furthermore, the lack of legitimate economic opportunities in the region can create a cycle of poverty and drug trafficking, further fueling the hidden drug abuse problem.** 2

## **Drug Use Trends and Challenges in Asia**

### **Drug Use and Addiction in Asia**

An article published by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime explores the historical and socio-cultural context of drug use and addiction in Asia3. The author argues that the use of mind-altering drugs is deeply rooted in Asian culture, with opium and cannabis being widely used for various reasons3. This historical context has contributed to the normalization of drug use in some communities, making it more challenging to address the issue of hidden drug abuse.

### **Drug Use Trends in Asia**

Several trends contribute to the hidden drug abuse problem in Asia. There is an increasing use of heroin, particularly among young people3. This trend is concerning as heroin is highly addictive and can lead to serious health consequences. Furthermore, there is an emphasis on law enforcement approaches and strict penalties for drug offenses in many Asian countries3. While law enforcement plays a crucial role in drug control, an overreliance on punitive measures can deter individuals from seeking help for drug addiction, pushing drug use further underground. Additionally, there is a lack of adequate or comprehensive treatment and rehabilitation services for drug abusers in many parts of Asia3. This lack of access to treatment can exacerbate the hidden drug abuse problem, as individuals may be reluctant to seek help due to fear of stigma or legal consequences.

## **Drug Situation in China**

The 2022 China Drug Situation Report provides insights into the drug problem in China4. While there was a decrease in registered drug users in 2022, the 2023 report indicates an increase in drug-related criminal cases, suspects captured, and drugs seized5. This suggests a potential resurgence in drug use and trafficking after the COVID-19 pandemic. The report also highlights the challenges posed by the abuse of new types of drugs and substitute substances4. The report also highlights the significant role of international drug trafficking in China's drug problem, with most drugs originating from overseas sources4. This influx of drugs from abroad contributes to the hidden nature of drug abuse, as it often occurs outside the purview of law enforcement agencies.

**There was an increase in the trafficking of ketamine and cocaine into China from abroad in 2022\.** 4 Ketamine mainly originated from Cambodia and Thailand, transiting through the southeast coast of China to Hong Kong SAR and Taiwan Province4. **These drugs were primarily smuggled into China's southeastern coastal regions through international logistics channels or by having foreign drug lords remotely instruct domestic criminals to rent ships, which then rendezvoused with drug-carrying vessels on the high seas and transported the drugs to China.** 5 This complex network of international drug trafficking makes it more difficult for law enforcement to control the flow of drugs into the country.

## **Emerging Drug Trafficking Trends in Southeast Asia**

**Cambodia has emerged as a key transit and, to some extent, production point for the regional drug trade.** 6 The discovery of a series of industrial-scale clandestine ketamine laboratories, processing warehouses, and storage facilities across the country has raised concerns in the region and among international partners6. This development highlights the dynamic nature of drug trafficking and the need for continuous monitoring and adaptation of law enforcement strategies.

## **Drug Trafficking and Concerns in Specific Regions**

Concerns over the influx of crystal meth into Australia have been raised7. This highlights the transnational nature of drug trafficking and the need for international cooperation to address the problem. A Chinese cocaine haul also indicates a growing drug problem in the region7. This suggests that cocaine, traditionally more prevalent in the Americas and Europe, is becoming increasingly available in Asia. A UN official has called on the Philippines to stop targeting street sellers in its war on drugs7. This highlights the human rights concerns associated with aggressive drug control policies and the need for a balanced approach that prioritizes both public health and human rights.

## **Consequences of Hidden Drug Abuse**

The hidden drug abuse problem has far-reaching consequences, extending beyond individual health issues. A research brief from the World Drug Report 2023 focuses on the drug-crime nexus in the Amazon Basin8. The brief examines the impact of drug trafficking and related crime issues in countries that share the Amazon Basin rainforest, including Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, and Colombia. The brief highlights the environmental and social consequences of drug trafficking in the region, including deforestation, violence, and corruption.

A report from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime discusses the economic and social impact of drug abuse9. The report highlights the financial costs associated with drug-related crime, healthcare, and lost productivity. It also emphasizes the social consequences of drug abuse, such as increased crime rates, family breakdown, and community instability.

## **Social Capital and Social Networks of Hidden Drug Abuse**

A study published in the *International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health* investigates the social capital and social networks of hidden drug abuse10. This study found that drug supply and transaction networks are often extensive and multi-layered, but also secretive, with high closure levels10. This type of network is supported by bonding, bridging, and linking social capital, providing convenient supply modes and offering drug abusers psychological comfort and safety10. These factors encourage hidden drug abuse to prevail and allow drug abusers to remain unidentified.

## **Hidden Drug Abuse in Hong Kong**

A study published in *Frontiers in Psychiatry* examines the phenomenon of hidden drug abuse in Hong Kong11. The study identifies five stages of drug use, from social acquaintance to social isolation, and explores the factors that contribute to the hidden nature of drug abuse, such as the decline in physical health, self-perceived discrimination, and the co-occurrence of psychiatric symptoms.

### **Venues and Methods of Hidden Drug Abuse**

Hidden drug abuse often takes place in private settings, such as homes, resort houses, and online platforms10. Drug-taking activities can occur in various situations, including organized and commercialized settings like small-scale discos and clubs, spontaneous and self-initiated gatherings among peers, and even in public spaces like beaches and cinemas10. This diversity of venues and methods makes it more challenging for law enforcement and public health officials to identify and address hidden drug abuse.

## **Challenges in Addressing Hidden Drug Abuse**

The hidden nature of drug abuse presents significant challenges for law enforcement and public health interventions. **The diversification of drug production and the emergence of new synthetic drugs make it more difficult for law enforcement to track and control the drug supply, thereby exacerbating the hidden drug problem.** 6 **The shift from traditional drugs like heroin to psychotropic substances like methamphetamine and cocaine also contributes to the hidden nature of drug abuse.** 10 **The less apparent withdrawal symptoms of psychotropic drugs make it harder to identify abusers, thus contributing to the hidden drug problem.** 10

## **Conclusion**

The hidden drug abuse problem poses a significant challenge to public health and law enforcement efforts worldwide. This research focus has highlighted the various factors that contribute to the hidden nature of drug abuse, including the adaptive nature of drug trafficking, the shift to new types of drugs and substitute substances, the role of social networks in facilitating drug use, and the lack of adequate treatment and prevention services. The consequences of hidden drug abuse are far-reaching, impacting not only individual health but also community well-being, economic stability, and the environment. **Greater awareness, research, and international collaboration are urgently needed to address this growing concern and develop effective strategies for prevention and intervention.**

Promoting Social Movements with Media Activism to Combating South Korean
People’s Plastic Surgery Obsession: Social Movements and Media Activisim
```
**Introduction – Background/Situation:**

- Technological advancements have led to significant developments in medical
    procedures aimed at pursuing physical perfection.
- In particular, plastic surgery involves surgical interventions to alter a person's
    appearance. Within the broader practice of plastic surgery, there are two
    subcategories: While reconstructive surgery is defined as a form of medical
    intervention aimed at rectifying deformities or appearance damage caused by
    catastrophic events, congenital conditions, or cancer (Bennett, 2015), cosmetic
    surgery is characterized as an entirely optional surgery that focuses on enhancing
    one's external appearance, solely driven by individual choice and preference
    (Griffiths & Mullock, 2018).
- In recent years, South Korea has become the plastic surgery capital of the world,
    where every one in three people under 30 resort to the services of plastic surgeons
    (Plate, 2020).
**Thesis statement:** In light of the increasing prevalence of plastic surgery addiction among
Korean citizens, the introduction of educational programs and stronger governance on the
plastic surgery industry through regulatory policies are practical measures, while positive use
of media platforms to promote positive body image can be the ultimate solution.


**Main body (I) – Problem:**
**_Topic sentence:_** The abuse of plastic surgery by South Koreans has become a growing issue
as society increasingly idolizes standardized beauty and the public becomes more obsessed
with it.
**_Proof:_** With 13.5 cosmetic procedures per 1000 individuals, South Korea ranks first globally
in the number of aesthetic operations performed per capita in the world (Yoon & Kim, 2020).
**_Proof:_** According to the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery report in 2011, an
estimate 650,000 cosmetic procedures were performed in South Korea annually (International
Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery [ISAPS], 2011).
**_Proof:_** An analysis of 16 research studies reveals that 20% of South Korea’s population has
sought the assistance help of plastic surgeons at least once in their lifetime (Yoon & Kim,
2020).
**Cause 1:** The emphasis of standardized beauty by the mass media exerts much pressure on
Koreans to conform to the portrayed beauty ideal, contributing to the development of plastic
surgery addiction.

- Those who refuse to alter their physical appearance to meet these cultural
    expectations are often blamed for resisting social norms and eventually become
    outcasts (Kim, 2009).
**Cause 2:** Intense competition in the marriage and employment market also fuels the growing
addiction to cosmetic surgery among Koreans.
- Marriage is considered a top priority for Korean women to enhance social and
financial status, so eligible women are under immense pressure to get ahead in the
dating market by going under the knife (Suissa, 2008).


- Similarly, men are eager to enhance their competitiveness in the job market, as shown
    in a study whereby the majority of respondents believe that plastic surgery induces a
    positive effect on career advancement (Park et al., 2019).
**Consequences:** The long-term consequences of plastic surgery addiction extend beyond
physical risks, encompassing a decline in originality and self-identity.
- Promoting Western beauty standards without question, while attaching negative
connotations to certain natural Korean physical attributes, will undermine the cultural
identities of South Koreans and contribute to the perpetuation of oppressive systems
(Kim, 2009).
- Moreover, the rise in unnecessary medical procedures raises the probability of
complications and postoperative side effects in plastic surgery as substantiated by the
Korea Consumer Agency's report of 130 compensation claims filed for damages
resulting from such procedures in 2012 (We & Kim, 2013).

**Main body (II) – Solution:
Solution 1:** Promoting positive body image through comprehensive education could be a
viable solution.

- This can be done through cross-sectional collaboration between government
    departments and education institutions to implement Body Confidence Campaigns.
- These territory-wide campaigns may focus on nurturing multiple competencies of
    young people and equipping teenagers with critical thinking skills to smartly analyze
    media portrayals (Government Equalities Office, 2013).
_Evaluation:_ These measures may increase teenagers’ self-esteem and criticality, leaving them
less vulnerable to media manipulation and control. However, education is a time-consuming
process that requires significant time before it can effectively influence an entire generation.


**Solution 2:** Imposing stringent government regulations is an alternative approach to
discourage potential entrants from the plastic surgery market.

- Under the current plastic surgery regulations, the existing ordinance led to the
    accusation of 11 illegal brokers in May 2013 for violating medical laws, while 150
    middlemen were prohibited from leaving South Korea to prevent further exploitation
    of patients (Williams, 2017).
- Legal restrictions can therefore exert a deterring effect, forcing agents and middlemen
    in the industry to comply with requirements and adopt more socially responsible
    behavior.
_Evaluation_ : However, sociological research suggests that the government sometimes fails to
exercise sound judgement in the absence of credible information on the incidence of medical
procedures (Griffiths & Mullock, 201 8 ). That means legislation still has room for
improvement in terms of in effectively overseeing inappropriate usage of medical procedures
in plastic surgeries.
**Solution 3:** Utilizing the power of mass and social media platforms to challenge long-
standing cultural norms and promote awareness demonstrates a promising and practical
solution.
- South Korea is a nation of Internet-savvy users (Kim, 2009) so the web can be used to
influence consumers’ decision making.
- A notable example is the success of the 'Escape the Corset' campaign in 2018, which
effectively challenged the excessive emphasis on physical appearance and dismantled
patriarchal perceptions (Kuhn, 2019; Lee, 2019).
- In this campaign, women posted defiant pictures of shorn hair and smashed cosmetic
products on the social media, leading to a significant reduction of KRW$53.5 billion
in cosmetics sales (Edraki, 2019).


- Using the mass and social media skillfully to raise awareness may be a solution to
    break down traditional cultural norms (Givhan & Morales, 2020).
_Evaluation:_ The media is a double-edged sword. Mass and social media may promote
negative self-expression and imposing undesirable social norms on citizens, causing anxiety,
depression and addiction. However, if used skilfully, the media can also be used as an
intervention to drive meaningful social movements that encourage healthy life styles and
positive body image. ( 972 words)

Fighting Against the Toxic Overwork Culture in Japan: Robotic Revolution, Support
Systems, and Regulatory Reforms
```
**Introduction:**

- **Hook:** The death of 31-year-old Miwa Sado after she worked overtime for 150 hours
    recently has brought the problem of overwork in Japan to international light (Ma, 2017).
- **Background/Definition:** Japanese terms such as “karoshi” and “karojisatsu,” which
    translate to “death by overwork” and “suicide due to overwork” respectively, are common
    in the community due to its toxic work culture (Ke, 2012, p. 55; Nishiyama & Johnson,
    1997, p. 625).
**Thesis Statement:** To combat the toxic overwork culture in Japan, implementing a robotic
revolution to counteract the rapid population decline, self-validation counselling and
management coaching in corporations, and new government regulations could be possible
solutions.

**Main body (I) – Problem:**
**_Topic sentence:_** The toxic overwork culture in Japanese workplaces and related workaholic
habits of Japanese citizens have been worrying.

- **_Proof:_** Generally, Japanese companies require almost 80 hours of overtime every week
    (Xiao, et al., 2019).


- **_Proof:_** In 2020, the average Japanese worked 1,714 hours compared with 1 ,538 and 1, 386
    hours in the United Kingdom and Germany respectively (Organisation for Economic Co-
    operation and Development, 2020).
- **_Proof:_** There were 2,018 deaths due to _karoshi_ and _karojisatsu_ in Japan in 2018 (Statista,
    2020). In other words, approximately 10–12% of the total suicides committed in Japan
    were due to the long working hours and unfavourable working conditions (National Police
    Agency of Japan, 2015).

**_Cause 1:_** Japan’s rapid population decline adds pressure on the existing labour.

- In 2005, the population growth in Japan fell for the first time since 1899 and has since
    then been on a steadily declining trend (Tsuya, 2017).
- The combination of an aging population and a decline in birth rates has resulted in a
    significant decrease in Japan's working-age population. As of 2019, there were only 75.
    million individuals between the ages of 15 and 64, accounting for 59.5% of the total
    population (Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, 2019).
- This leads to a shortage of personnel within companies, further resulting in increased
    workloads delegated to employees (Takeo & Dormido, 2019).
**_Cause 2:_** The work culture in the Japanese workplace also promotes extremely long working
hours.
- Unlike Western society, Japanese society operates based on solidarity and hierarchy
    (Matsuoka & Shimazu, 2014).
- Workers refrain from taking holidays or leaving early lest they might lose credibility in the
    eyes of their peers and managers or burden their co-workers with more tasks (Pickar et al.,
    2016).


- The Japanese are highly conscious of others’ judgment and in turn neglect their own self-
    interest by taking up overtime work just to impress their mangers or reduce their
    colleagues’ workload for higher social acceptance (Thiele, 2018).
- Thus, the power distance and collectivism in the workplace lead to the formation of
    workaholic attitudes (Hodulak, 2017).
**_Cause 3:_** The lack of comprehensive regulations contributes to the overwork culture.
- Though _karoshi_ has been an issue since the 1990s, the government did not officially set a
    proper legal limit on working hours until 2018 (“Overtime work ‘less than 100 hours a
    month’,” 2018).
- Ironically, the numerous loopholes within the regulation ended up increasing the working
    hours limit from 46 hours to 100 hours for “special months” (Okunuki, 2018).
**Consequences:**
- Medically speaking, overwork can lead to _karoshi_ , i.e., death due to acute heart failure or
    subarachnoid haemorrhage and can also cause mental health issues such as burnouts and
    depression (Pickar et al., 2016).
- Economically, the impact of death resulting from overwork extends beyond the affected
    families but can also have significant repercussions for industries as a result of lawsuits
    and lost productivity (Chelala, 2019).

**Main body (II) – Solutions:**
**_Topic sentence 1:_** A direct solution to the shrinking working population is a robotic
revolution.

- Since the Japanese are not open to mass immigration due to cultural differences, advanced
    robots can be employed for various purposes in different sectors to increase productivity
    and reduce costs (Fensom, 2015).


- With the help of household robots, women will also become more open to pregnancy,
    which could lead to a boom in the population rate (Saga, 2018).
- **_Evaluation:_** Nearly all current jobs could be automated in the future, leading to an
    employment dilemma in the country (Fensom, 2015). Also, due to the increased
    dependence on robots, people may feel increasingly isolated and may be unable or
    unwilling to form long-term interpersonal and romantic relations (Simons, 2017).
**Topic sentence 2:** Providing relevant training for both employees and employers to change
their mind-set is another possible solution.
- Introducing self-validation counselling to Japanese corporate systems could help
    overworked employees better understand their “individualistic self,” changing their
    workaholic attitude and their priorities (Forbes Coaches Council, 2018).
- Management coaching can lead to internal and social change. If the manager creates an
    open and approachable environment, promoting work-life balance and destigmatizing
    leaving work on time, workers can lose their fear of social rejection or job instability
    (Hodulak, 2017).
- **_Evaluation:_** Dilemmas such as voluntary overwork and unused vacation days can be
    prevented (Weinberg et al., 2010). However, the idea of self-validation counselling may
    meet resistance from the supporters of the existing corporate culture of group conformity
    (Pickar et al., 2016).
**Topic sentence 3:** The most impactful solution would be government intervention by
forming new laws that set strict limits on maximum working hours.
- This could be accompanied by increasing the number of labour standard inspectors to
    enhance inspections of businesses suspected of subjecting their employees to overwork
    (Vargas, 2017).


- Laws may also be passed to make labour unions more powerful in pursuing penalties
    when violations of working laws occur in companies (Matsangou, 2018).
- **_Evaluation_** : These laws will end overwork and more leisure time will help solve Japan’s
    second most significant problem - low amount of consumer spending (Tsunoda, 2018).
- However, the community may not have the motivation to comply, as the Japanese
    government has been failing at implementing related reforms since 2014. For example,
    after passing “Premium Friday Program” in 2017, which aimed to allow workers to leave
    early on the last Friday of every month, a survey found that only 3.7% of workers actually
    left early on Fridays (Intage Holdings Inc., 2017). (Word count: 997)

Resolving Bride-trafficking in the Asian Region: Education and Regulation
```
**Introduction - Background/Situation:**
 The imbalanced gender ratio in rural areas of China leads to difficulties in seeking
spouses.
 In rural areas, the number of single males is higher than the number of single females by
20.25 million, creating a disparity ratio of 130 males to 100 females (National Bureau of
Statistics of China, 2017; Tiefenbrun & Edwards, 2008).
 This gender disparity creates a cross-country bride-trafficking market in Asia aiming to
serve the marital needs of single males in China.
**Thesis statement:** Bride-trafficking in Asia violates women’s rights and has detrimental
impacts at both the individual and societal levels; however, it could be resolved by educating
women in remote areas, strengthening both national and international law enforcement, and
developing a well-regulated cross-border marriage agency.

**Main body (I) – Problem:**
**_Topic sentence:_** The problem of bride trafficking has widely spread throughout Asia, driven
by the considerable demand for brides in China.
**_Proof:_** Bride-trafficking still exists in several Asian countries, such as Cambodia, Myanmar,
Pakistan, and Vietnam, and the number of women trafficked has risen (Human Rights Watch,
2021).


**_Proof:_** About 21,000 women and girls from northern Myanmar were trafficked as brides to
the rural areas of China, where they were coerced into marrying men residing in Yunnan
Province between 2013 and 2017 (Robinson & Branchini, 2018).
**_Cause 1:_** The pervasive issue of bride trafficking in Asia can be attributed, in part, to the
implementation of China's one-child policy from 1979 to 2015, which aimed to control
population growth.
 The deeply rooted patriarchy and perceived higher agricultural productivity created a
preference for newborn boys over girls in rural regions. This led to female infanticide and
a vigorous decline in the female population in rural areas (Sudbeck, 2012).
 As reported by the National Bureau of Statistics of China (2010), the male population had
increased from 108 to about 118 for every 100 females between 1982 and 2010. With this
burgeoning demand for brides, a black market for trading women emerged in Asia.
**_Cause 2:_** Another cause is the low socioeconomic status of women and the prevalence of
gender inequality, leading to the commodification of women as objects rather than
individuals.
 According to the World Economic Forum (2018), trafficked brides are mainly from
Vietnam, Myanmar, and Pakistan, which rank 77th, 88th, and 148th out of 149 countries.
 The public security and the economy of these states are less mature, so women’s rights
remain unprotected. Women are considered a burden on the family, making them more
vulnerable as prey to the traders (Saha, 2018). Impoverished families tend to sell their
daughters in exchange for wealth. And families in poverty may pay less attention to their
daughters so traffickers could easily kidnap women through security loopholes.
**_Consequences:_** Bride trafficking in Asia results in elevated crime and violence, including a
surge in the crime rate, inhumane torture of traded brides, and severe adverse effects on their
mental and physical well-being.


 Bride abduction induces crime and violence in China, which increases the crime rate by
about 14.28%, contributing to social instability (Saha, 2018).
 The traded brides may face inhuman torture. Pressured to become pregnant as quickly as
possible, some are compelled to undergo forced fertility treatment (Human Rights Watch,
2021).
 More than one-third of the 51 Vietnamese women and girls rescued from bride-trafficking
to China reported being slapped, shoved, or hit with hard objects. Such violence caused
depression and anxiety, harming women’s mental health and physical health deeply
(Stöckl et al., 2017).

**Main body (I) – Solutions:**
**_Topic sentence 1:_** Strengthening education for women in remote and rural areas can be a
potential solution to combat bride trafficking.
 Traffickers often target uneducated and underprivileged women, misleading them with
false promises of lucrative job opportunities in developed countries.
 Without sufficient knowledge and critical thinking, these women are more susceptible to
accepting such offers and are forced to marry and bear children for their abusers (Stöckl et
al., 2017).
 Governments and NGOs could launch education campaigns to alert women of traffickers’
deceptions by visiting remote villages.
 **_Evaluation:_** This prevents females from being misled by traffickers. However, women
who are not able to defend themselves physically might still get abducted when traffickers
use force.
**_Topic sentence 2:_** Strengthening cooperation among law enforcement authorities in Asian
countries is essential to eliminate cross border trafficking.


 In developing countries such as Vietnam and Cambodia, the law enforcement agencies
often lack information, well-trained officers and funding to trace the trafficking
organizations; therefore, establishing effective international ties with the more developed
countries may help solve the problem by learning from their experience (Friesendorf,
2009).
 Alignment of legal actions across countries will raise the risk and cost of bride-trafficking,
which enhances the deterrent effect.
 **_Evaluation_** **:** When carrying out cross-country actions, language barriers and cultural
differences may arise. The governments can provide resources to overcome language
barriers while senior officials could more closely oversee subordinates’ code of conduct,
ensuring the prevention of discrimination and conflicts when cooperating.
**_Topic sentence 3:_** Establishing a credible and well-regulated cross-border marriage agency
industry may be the ultimate solution.
 The unsatisfied demand for brides in China could lead to social unrest (Saha, 2018). To
maintain a balanced inflow of non-local brides, it is crucial to establish a legally regulated
and mature cross-border marriage agency industry that can ensure long-term sustainability.
 Such marriage agencies can provide services at a reasonable and regulated price. The
authorities could monitor the legality and validity of processes such as the matching
arrangements, marriage registration, immigration application, and the protection of brides’
rights.
 A study found that Vietnamese women from rural areas are eager to marry Chinese men
because of their desire for economic stability (Su, 2009). Thus, the key is not to stop inter-
country marriage altogether but rather to provide a gateway for these brides to avoid being
exploited.


 **_Evaluation:_** A well-developed and well-regulated legal market would put an end to
inhumane bride-trafficking. (99 3 words)

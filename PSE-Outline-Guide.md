# ELTU1001 Foundation English for University Studies

# Course Description

This course aims to lay the comprehensive English language foundation needed for university studies by engaging students in multi-modal learning activities. In particular, students are guided to plan and complete an expository essay and deliver a corresponding presentation using writing and speaking skills acquired in the course. Learning topics include identifying features of academic and expository writing, planning and drafting a problem-solution essay, conducting research, documenting sources, paraphrasing and summarising, structuring presentations, and enhancing verbal and non-verbal delivery skills. Course-tied workshops will be provided in support of students’ learning. This course is compulsory for first-year students, except for those who have attained HKDSE English level 5 or above or its equivalence. This course is a prerequisite for Level Two and Three courses. 

# Course Objectives

### Intended Learning Outcomes 

It is expected that by the end of this course students will be able to:

identify common features of academic texts;

recognise common types and organisational patterns of expository writing;

define an appropriate topic and conduct research for an expository essay;

• select and organise relevant information into a structured, coherent text;

• avoid plagiarism by documenting, paraphrasing, summarising and quoting sources appropriately; 

• critically evaluate claims and corresponding evidence;

• adopt a process-based approach to writing tasks; 

• deliver an informative presentation effectively and confidently; and

• review and reflect on their own language learning.

## Individual Writing Assignment – Problem-solution Essay

## Aims: 

• To determine how well you can exercise the expository writing skills acquired from the course

• To determine how well you can research for and make use of relevant and credible information and data to support your claims and analyses 

• To give you an opportunity to gain formative feedback from your classmates and teacher 

## Overview of the assessment: 

Problem-solution Essays (PSEs) are a standard type of essays written at universities. Often, teachers hope that their students will use such essays as an opportunity to find out more about their field, and to develop skills that are useful in all fields: defining problems clearly, understanding and explaining causes, and thinking critically about solutions. 

## Assessment task: 

For Assessment 1, you are to write your own research and evidence-based PSE on a topic of your choice. In your essay, you should clearly articulate the problem and define its scope; show your audience the seriousness of the problem with proof; discuss the causes of the problem, as well as the consequences were it to remain unsolved; and explain two to three actionable solutions, critically evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of each. 

### Topic selection and essay planning:

You should choose your topic carefully. Your topic area should be novel, current and of interest to a larger community. You should conduct research to investigate and narrow the problem down to a more specific scope and context by focusing on one region, one country or one city, or even on a specific target population or condition. You should research extensively to locate professional solutions put forward by experts and check that they can be exercised in the target community by relevant authorities or stakeholders. In other words, discussing a problem “in a vacuum” without specifying a scope and providing relevant proof or proposing “self-help” type of solutions as advice

to individuals are considered failure to fulfil task requirements and will lead to significant mark deduction. 

You may take a look at the good essay samples written by former ELTU1001 students (available on Blackboard) to observe how they select and formulate focused and specific topics. However, please avoid using the same topics as shown in the good student samples, unless you are confident that you could tackle the issue from a very different perspective or locate ample new information and data. Also avoid overused, clichéd topics such as “saturating landfills,” “air pollution,” “bullying,” “obesity,” “housing problem,” “aging population,” or “global warming,” which may not interest your readers any more. Check with your teacher in advance if you are unsure about your topic choice. 

## Technical details: 

You will first submit an outline (20%) of 700–1000 words. The outline should be written in full sentences instead of phrases or fragments, but you may present your ideas in point form. Sources of reference must be properly included to support your content. Your teacher will mark and return your outline with comments and a completed assessment form. An individual consultation session will also be arranged for you to discuss your performance with your teacher. 

Based on your teacher’s feedback, you will write a first draft. Pair up with a classmate to complete a peer-review exercise by evaluating the work of each other with reference to a step-by-step guide. This may be done in class or assigned as homework. You will then revise your essay further and submit a final draft (40%) of 1000–1300 words. Your teacher may request that you hand in a hard copy as well. 

Both your outline and your final draft should be uploaded to VeriGuide (for submission) and Blackboard (as a backup). All submissions should adhere to stated word limits and formatting requirements, or a penalty will be applied. All word limits include in-text citations but exclude the end-of-text reference list. 

## Referencing requirements:

All key ideas should be supported by credible sources. All sources should be cited (in-text citations) and referenced (end-of-text reference list) in APA style$( 7 ^ { ( h ) } e d . )$in both the outline and the final draft of your essay. You will risk getting a low mark in terms of both “Content” and “Referencing” if you fail to properly cite sources for ideas and data included in your work. 

A minimum of five references to English scholarly sources (e.g., refereed journal papers and academic books) should be included. Submissions failing to fulfil this basic requirement may receive an F grade. 

Students may include Chinese/non-English sources or non-academic/popular sources (such as newspapers or government reports) as additional references if they wish to, but students should consider their sources carefully; the quality and quantity of credible academic and authoritative sources used will directly affect your scores. Use of unreliable and unsuitable popular sources (such as Wikis, blogposts and random websites) will be penalized. 

## Formatting requirements: 

• State your full name, English name/preferred name, student number, course code and class section

• Font and spacing: Use 12-point Times New Roman or 11-point Calibri. Use double spacing

• Alignment: Align text to the left (leave right margin ragged and do not use full justification)

• Paragraphing: Indent the first line of every paragraph by 0.5 inch. Number all pages 

• Margin: Leave a 1-inch margin on all sides of the page. Include an accurate word count at the end of the essay (before the “References” page)
